The two major problems with passwords are when they are easy to guess based on knowledge of the user (for example, wife's maiden name) and when they are susceptible to dictionary attacks (that is, using a dictionary as the source of guesses).

          <td>Electronic mail is one of the most popular features of the Internet. With access to Internet e-mail, someone can potentially correspond with any one of millions of people worldwide. Some of the threats associated with e-mail are:<br>
      ->Impersonation: The sender address on Internet e-mail cannot be trusted because the sender can create a false return address. Someone could have modified the header in transit, or the sender could have connected directly to the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) port on the target computer to enter the e-mail.<br>
      ->Eavesdropping: E-mail headers and contents are transmitted in the clear text if no encryption is used. As a result, the contents of a message can be read or altered in transit. The header can be modified to hide or change the sender, or to redirect the message.

          <td>This refers to the recording and retransmission of message packets in the network. Packet replay is a significant threat for programs that require authentication sequences, because an intruder could replay legitimate authentication sequence messages to gain access to a system. Packet replay is frequently undetectable, but can be prevented by using packet time stamping and packet sequence counting.

As a result, a cracker can obtain sensitive information such as passwords, data, and procedures for performing functions. It is possible for a cracker to eavesdrop by wiretapping, using radio, or using auxiliary ports on terminals. It is also possible to eavesdrop using software that monitors packets sent over the network.</td>

          <td>In network spoofing, a system presents itself to the network as though it were a different system (computer A impersonates computer B by sending B's address instead of its own). The reason for doing this is that systems tend to operate within a group of other trusted systems. Trust is imparted in a one-to-one fashion; computer A trusts computer B (this does not imply that system B trusts system A). Implied with this trust is that the system administrator of the trusted system is performing the job properly and maintaining an appropriate level of security for the system. Network spoofing occurs in the following manner: if computer A trusts computer B and computer C spoofs (impersonates) computer B, then computer C can gain otherwise-denied access to computer A.
